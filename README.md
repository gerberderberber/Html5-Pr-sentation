# Html5-Pr-sentation
This is a presentation as an exercise for Markdown.

We write some text and some *italic* stuff. Including some Picture or a dog ![bla](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rhRAF91_7jI/maxresdefault.jpg). Well actually it is not a dog picture but rather some youtube blabla picture.  

On another note notice the [weather](https://www.google.ch/search?q=wetter+basel&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab&gfe_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=9rK4WtLNHaTC8geLn7-wCQ). It is quite nice today!
